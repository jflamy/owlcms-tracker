node tests/check-websocket.js

# Test 428 response with missing preconditions
node tests/test-428-response.js

# Load sample data
node tests/test-load-sample.js

# Send sample data (shell script)
./tests/test-sample-data.sh
```

### From Tests Directory

Or navigate to the tests directory first:

```bash
cd tests

# Run any test
node test-428-response.js
node check-websocket.js
