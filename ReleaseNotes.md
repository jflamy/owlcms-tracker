- 2.20.2: Team rankings can now be limited to top N teams and can be forced to show only total points.

## 2.19

- 2.19.6: Fixes for vertical layout and more robust scoreboard timers.
- 2.19.5: Show snatch and clean-and-jerk ranks for three-medal events; fix the leader-from-previous-sessions header.
- 2.19.4: Hide the record block on scoreboards during breaks, ceremonies, and done states when there is no current athlete.
- 2.19.3: Fix behavior and use translations when the announcer goes to "No Session" and starts a new one.

- 2.19.0: Scoreboards correctly track closed tabs and log the number of connected users.

## 2.18

- 2.18.12: Idle scoreboard tabs now release their server SSE stream after a five-minute hidden grace period. A hidden or quiet tab flushes everything else about the session after 30 minutes and prompts the user to reload.
- 2.18.11: Authentication fixes; keys are systematically compared. An empty Tracker key disables authentication.
- 2.18.10: Logging cleanup to show at-a-glance status of a simulation feeding Tracker.
- 2.18.9: Standard scoreboards now behave correctly with large sessions and on smaller devices such as phones; also includes portrait-mode fixes.
- 2.18.9: Scoreboards in the default bundle no longer hide the down signal too early.
- 2.18.8: Use the more general label "Open" for opening a plugin from the Options page.
- 2.18.7: Removed an unfinished partial implementation of plugins that would run on server startup. This will be redone with better use cases.
- 2.18.6: Plugin option defaults can now be saved from the options modal using a built-in "Save as Defaults" button. Overrides are persisted as `config-override.json5` with comments and trailing commas. The legacy `config-override.js` format is no longer loaded; re-save defaults from the modal to migrate.
- 2.18.6: Fix a bug where comma-separated string defaults (e.g. `'S,J,U,V'`) were truncated when handling defaults.
- 2.18.5: Move plugin-specific unit tests into their plugin or submodule.
- 2.18.4: Stale provisional records that do not match the current event are no longer included in the results book.
- 2.18.3: Map flag files for countries and North American provinces, states, and territories from the full name to the two-letter jurisdiction or three-letter IOC code. For example, Ontario can be found under `ON.svg` and Australia under `AUS.svg`.
- 2.18.2: Packaged plugins can now provide editable `config-override.js` files for runtime option defaults.
  - Custom zip packaging copies hand-authored override files and generates missing ones for selected plugins with options.
  - OBS packages include override files for install-specific host, path, platform, and scene defaults.
- 2.18.1: Add timestamps to packaged ZIPs because the version number shown is that of Tracker, not the included plugins.
- 2.18.0: Include a marker file indicating that a non-standard build was created using `npm run zip`.
  - The file includes the plugins included, to provide correct warnings or errors when updating/importing.
- 2.18.0: Review the `npm run zip` command options for packaging a custom Tracker.
  - `--standard` includes only the built-in plugins from the default checkout.
  - `--include` adds plugins or extensions by display name.
  - `--include-category` and `--include-categories` add plugins or extensions by the category declared in `config.js`.
  - `--submodule` and `--submodules` add whole submodules.
  - Use commas to separate listed items.
  - Selection is additive.
  - Extensions must be selected explicitly with `--include` or `--include-type`.
  - Selecting an extension automatically pulls in its base plugin.
  - Zip filenames created with `npm run zip` use a stable asset name by default, for example `owlcms-tracker_2.18.0.zip`; pass `--timestamp` to append timestamp metadata.
  - `--name <metadata>` appends control-panel-preserved package metadata before the timestamp, for example `owlcms-tracker_2.18.0+documents.2026-05-12.14h37.zip`.

## 2.17

- 2.17.2: Improve the jury plugin's recording and trimming status display. Requires Replays 2.3.4.
- 2.17.1: Adding plugins requires restarting the server to avoid running `initialize()` too often.

## 2.12

- 2.12.0: Fix packaging of combined plugins with shared content.

## 2.9

- 2.9.0: Remove large unnecessary dependencies specific to some plugins; Puppeteer is no longer included by default.
