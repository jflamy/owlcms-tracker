# Compliance & Change Tracking (Local Working Files)

**⚠️ All files in this folder except README.md are gitignored.**

This folder contains working documents, change logs, and compliance tracking created during development iterations. Only this README.md is committed to the repository to explain the folder's purpose.

## Purpose

Use this folder for:
- ✅ **Temporary change tracking** while refactoring
- ✅ **Compliance verification** during updates
- ✅ **Development notes** that don't belong in permanent docs
- ✅ **AI agent context** during long coding sessions
- ✅ **Personal work logs** and decisions

**These files are local-only** (gitignored):
- ❌ Not committed to repository (except README.md)
- ❌ Not shared between developers
- ❌ Can be deleted when work is complete
